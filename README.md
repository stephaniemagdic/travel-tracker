## Instructions for running and viewing

### Set-up:

Note: You must run both your local server and the fitlit application at the same time to use this application.

#### Step 1: Run your local server.
  * Go to the [fitlit-API]() and follow the instructions in the README.md to run your local server.
  * Make sure that the server is running in your terminal by checking that you see the following message in your terminal. `Travel Tracker is now running on http://localhost:3001 !`
#### Step 2: Run the travel tracker application/client.
  * You can access the travel tracker by `cloning this repository`, navigating to and `opening up your terminal`, and running the command `npm start` in your cloned project directory. This will run the bundle.js file, which will compile and run the application.
  * You should see the following message in your terminal: `running at http://localhost:8080/`
  * Copy and paste this url link (`http://localhost:8080/`) in your browser to view the application. 
  
`Note`: Make sure to run `npm install` in your terminal after cloning the repository to install dependencies needed for the application to run!

(NOTE TO SELF)
## Deploying to GitHub Pages

_If you are finished with the functionality and testing of your project_, then you can consider deploying your project to the web! This way anyone can play it without cloning down your repo.

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a great way to deploy your project to the web. Don't worry about this until your project is free of bugs and well tested!

If you _are_ done, you can follow [this procedure](./gh-pages-procedure.md) to get your project live on GitHub Pages.
